<h2> Energy Demand in Pakistan</h2>

<div class="main-body-paragraph"
<p> The world today faces substantial problematic issues in the form of economic crises, depleting resources and ever increasing demands of energy. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP 21 saw the world come together with the common objective of mitigating climate change and to limit the global temperature rise to below 2&degC compared to pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC, 2015). Pakistan is among the top ten countries identified as being most vulnerable to climate change, which is apparent from the substantial losses in life and infrastructure the country has had to endure in the last decade due to increased climate induced natural disasters.   The energy sector issues and development continue to act as the key constraints in the economy. </p>

<p>
  In the last five years, the gaps between energy supply and demand have continued to increase. Pakistan's energy appetite is expected to grow at an Annual Compound Growth Rate (ACGR) of 4.37% to 6.09 %.This growth in energy demand is contingent on Gross domestic product (GDP) growth and is likely to be in the range of 116 to 148 MTOE by FY 2022.  Following Exhibits shows the Energy Demand supply Projection of Pakistan up to FY 2022. For a developing country like Pakistan, these gaps pose a dire threat to its very existence.

<h2> Energy Consumption in Domestic Sector</h2>
<div class="main-body-paragraph"
<p> The breakdown of the energy consumption in various sectors reveals that the domestic sector accounts for the highest electricity consumption, with a total of 47% of the total electricity consumption. Hence, the energy consumption of residential buildings is a key area of focus for reducing the nation's overall energy demand.</P>
</div>

<div class="side-para">
<P> Within the domestic sector, the subdivision of the energy consumption reveals that gas and electricity are the major fuels of consumption, in which gas accounts for the maximum consumption with a total of 62.3%, while electricity accounts for 33.5%, as shown in Figure. However, within a Pakistani household, the highest annual cost among the various energy sources is that of electricity, which accounts for the bulk of the annual energy bill, and thus presents the greatest potential for cost savings through efficiency measures and conservation.</p>

<h2> Energy Efficiency and Occupant Behaviour</h2>
<div class="main-body-paragraph"
<p> It has been rightly said, <strong>&ldquo;buildings don't use energy, people do &rdquo;</strong> (Janda, 2011). Effective energy demand reduction in buildings requires accurate understanding of occupant energy consumption. In common practice, design and retrofitting of buildings is often based on static models or dynamic simulations and predicted thermal energy performance with assumptions or simplifications made in terms of building operations and use. Numerous studies reveal that estimates of energy consumption often vary widely from actual consumption, a variation which is defined as the 'performance gap' (Grubb, 1990) (Menezes, et al., 2012) (Sunikka-Blank & Galvin, 2012) (Zero-Carbon-Hub, 2014) (Palmer, et al., 2016). A four year, detailed in-depth evaluation of UK buildings carried out through the Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) Programme, founded by the National Energy Foundation, UK revealed that on average, buildings were using 3.6 times more energy than their designed estimates (Palmer, et al., 2016). Research has revealed that one key factor that results in this performance gap is occupant behaviour (Vlasova & Gram-Hanssen, 2014). Occupant lifestyle, behavior and social and cultural practices can result in a 4-6 times variation in similar type of buildings (Sunikka-Blank & Galvin, 2012) (Gram-Hanssen, 2010) (Zhun Yu, et al., 2011). Energy efficient occupant behavior can lead to energy savings ranging from 10-15% or more (Jain, et al., 2013) (Pisello & Asdrubali, 2014).</P>
<P
<P>The quantification and prediction of occupant behavior for improved building performance evaluations has been based on various approaches and theories of research. Conventional approaches in energy research focus on techno-economic aspects of energy consumption (Gram-Hanssen, 2014) (Sovacool, 2014) (Mahdavi, 2011). Some studies appoint an operation-based approach to role of occupants in energy demand (Lee & Malkawi, 2014) (Menezes, et al., 2012)</P>
<P
<P> However, for a more comprehensive understanding of actual household energy consumption, an amalgamation of inter-disciplinary research methods and theoretical frameworks is deemed more appropriate (Sovacool, 2014) (Schweber & Leiringer, 2012), particularly insights from social, psychological and behavioural studies (Gram-Hanssen, December 2012) (Shove, 2010)</P>
